<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  Power BI is a Microsoft program that deals with business analytics.  It can be used to provide useful insights to allow users to make fast and informed decisions.  For this class, students were tasked with completing the EdX training for Power BI. The course is self-paced and takes approximately 12 hours to complete.  The materials and content covered in the training greatly aide in understanding and working with Power BI. The videos and labs associated with the videos provide a clear and concise overview of the materials, with most videos noting additional sources of information, should you choose to go more in-depth with a given topic. Power BI is a robust and functional analytics service that I am happy to have learned and had the opportunity to work hands-on through the labs. The content of the course is broken up into 9 sections. In each section, the topics will be further divided into specific tools or functions of Power BI.  Each short video in these sections averages around 3-5 minutes per topic. At the end of a section, there are knowledge checks.  The knowledge check are short, often multiple choice questions that you have 2 attempts at answering the questions correctly.  After the knowledge checks associated with a given section, there will be lab exercises to complete.  The labs are generally straightforward and later labs will require you to have successfully completed previous labs. There is a brief introduction before starting the course, with an associated pre-course survey.  After providing a brief overview of how-to setup and install Power BI, the introduction gives you a brief overview of some of the features of Power BI and what it can be used for. 
  
  

-The first section covers Power BI Desktop Data Transformations.  This first section covers some basics like merging columns and other basic data transformations, such as changing data types and adding conditional statements.  



-Section 2 is Power BI Desktop Modelling.  This section builds on the previous and covers topics such as optimizing models, creating calculated columns, including/excluding, and grouping/binning. Like section 1, Section 2 has knowledge checks and a lab associated with the videos. 



-Section 3 is Power BI Desktop Visualization. This section covers a variety of different charts, plots, and diagrams that you can use to visualize your data. I found the map visualization to be very impressive compared to similar charts in Excel or R. The charts are also interactive and more precise values can be seen while hovering over a field or chart. This is one of the longer sections and really does a great job of covering the functionality and different real-world use cases for each of the different types of charts and how to customize the layout and colors of the charts.  I was really amazed at how robust and easy to use this software is. In addition, Section 3 also covers hierarchies, positioning and layout, as well as seeing a visual relationship between different data sets. Section 3 also has a lab associated with it.  



-Section 4 covers Power BI Service.  Section 4 covers a web-page style version of Power BI Desktop.  This can be used to publish and share various reports with other people.  These other users may be within your organization or may be a third-party. This section also covers different ways in which you can create a dashboard and use it to gain useful insights about your data. It covers how to add text boxes, how to filter the dashboard, as well as how to upload various files to Power BI Service. I was also very interested in the Natural Query Language that can be utilized through Power BI Service. Section 4 also has a lab associated with it. 



-Section 5 covers Working with Excel. This section details the various functions and uses of Excel with Power BI. It covers some more in-depth concepts with the types of data excel has and how Power BI handles them. There is an associated lab with Section 5. 

-Section 6 covers Organization Packs, Security and Groups.  This section details how to group and provide different security settings or who has access to what data. It covers how to create and manage groups. It discussed what a content pack is, how to create and manage one, and some particular functions when using OneDrive with Power BI. There is a lab associated with Section 6. 

-Section 7 covers Direct Connectivity. This section deals with how to link active SQL Azure, SQL Database, and SQL Server Analytics Service with Power BI. Section 7 has a lab associated with it. 

-Section 8 covers Developer API and contains the final lab required to complete the course. This section seemed to be far more technical than the rest. It covers how to create and manage custom visuals and embedding tiles to reports pages. 

-Section 9, the final section, covers some of the functionality of the mobile app. This final section has no knowledge checks or labs associated with it.  

Once you have completed these 9 sections, there is a Course Wrap-Up.  This is where they thank you for taking their course. There is a brief post-course survey where they ask your opinion about how you enjoyed the course, what you would improve, and how much you feel that you learned.

# Microsoft PowerShell (completed 30 October 2018)
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
  PowerShell is a task-based command-line scripting and shell language built on .Net framework. PowerShell lets you manage computers from the command-line. This course is far more technical than other skills learned in this class. PowerShell is a very robust and functional program. Tasks are performed by cmdlets or command-lets and allow administrators the ability to perform tasks on both local and remote machines. PowerShell also has an extremely helpful console-based help system. The videos in this course are longer than the videos of the other courses. This makes things slightly more challenging when re-watching content and trying to find a specific topic in the video. Don’t be afraid to go back and re-watch the videos to ensure you have the concepts down. I would also recommend to have the assessments open during the videos so you can pinpoint where a topic was discussed within the videos. I would also recommend speeding the video to 1.5x, it is still easy to follow along with the increase in speed. The videos are very in-depth explanations of the various uses and ways to automate procedures with PowerShell. The two presenters have good chemistry and provide useful anecdotes throughout the videos.

  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  This short course from GitHub walks you through some of the basics of GitHub. In particular, how to assign yourself, how to turn on GitHub Pages, creating branches, committing files, opening pull requests, reviewing changes, responding to reviews, and merging pull requests. In this first section, I had little to no trouble completing this. The next section deals with Markdown.  I did have trouble with this section. I have followed the instructions and got “stuck” part of the way through. I am being told to turn on GitHub Pages before I can continue, but I have already enabled GitHub Pages. I have tried disabling and re-enabling, to no avail. The next section deals with GitHub Pages. It walks you through how to enable GitHub Pages, customize your homepage, adding themes, etc. It also shows you how to create a blog post and add meta data to the blog post as well as various customization details. The next section deals with Managing Merge Conflicts. Be sure to pay attention to which file you are being asked to modify. This section will have you working with a number of different files and will not let you move on to the next issue if you have not edited the correct file. This tutorial does a good job of walking you through and explaining in detail what is happening to the files during various pull requests. The next section covers HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language. As a CIS graduate, this was simply a refresher for me and should be for most people in the class. It goes over some of the basics of creating titles, headers, adding images, creating lists and adding links to your page. The next topics covered are under the Community Starter Kit. This involves README and other documentation associated with projects as well as going over a “Code of Conduct”. The next sections covers how to prepare and upload a project to GitHub. The next topic discussed is how to migrate your repository to GitHub. Overall, I found this to be one of the more frustrating tutorials completed this semester.  I know that is will be very useful to me in my future career, and as I’m reviewing the course, there is a notification letting me know there is a more current version of this course available and I intend to re-complete this course.

  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
 For this skill, we were tasked with completing the Amazon Web Services Cloud Practitioner course offered through AWS Training. This training covers various products and services that Amazon offers.  This training provides an overview of what the services entail and a brief demonstration of how to use them. After every section there are knowledge checks before you can move on. These knowledge checks are multiple choice and can be retaken. Each section of this course covers different material and is generally broken up into short videos. Section 1 helps you to gain an understanding of the value of the cloud and the benefits of adopting AWS cloud. Throughout this course you will learn Cloud Concepts, AWS Core Services, Security, Architecting, Pricing and Support, as well as some other essentials. The course takes about 10 hours to complete and is relatively easy compared to the other skills learned during this course. The majority of the information covered is about amazon’s core services and how they operate. Amazon operate on a pay as you go scale, meaning you can allocate resources when you need them and not have to pay for when you don’t need them. AWS also offers a TCO calculator to give you a breakdown of pricing and usage details. Below I will detail a few of the things covered throughout the course in more detail.

-Security Groups: Act like a built-in firewall. The security groups provide control on what traffic you want to allow or deny by setting rules for different security groups. 

-Elastic Load Balancer. Load balancing aides with scalability. It will scale based on the traffic pattern it sees. You can view HTTP responses, the number of healthy/unhealthy hosts, and filter metrics based on availability zones. 

-Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).  S3 is managed cloud storage service that can be accessed anytime from anywhere, with virtually unlimited number of objects, and has rich security controls. It is commonly used for storing application assets, static web hosting, backup/disaster recovery, etc. 

-Amazon Glacier is a Data Archiving Solution. Glacier is used for storing Cold data. It offers long-term storage at low cost. Access can be limited by vault access policies. 

-Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed service that sets up and operates a relational database in the cloud. It handles challenges with managing a stand-alone relational database. Some common uses include mobile and online games, as well as web and mobile applications. 

-AWS Trusted Advisor is a tool that gives best practices to ensure you are utilizing your resources properly.  It can measure cost optimization, performance, security, and fault tolerances. 

-Amazon Shared Responsibility Model- This model essentially means that Amazon is responsible for operating managing services of the cloud. Customers are responsible for what they put on the cloud.

# Guru99 Linux Tutorial (completed 15 November 2018)
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
The Guru99 course on Linux begins with the basics and works its way up through more advanced operations. It starts with information about what an operating system is and who, Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux is. In addition, it gives a brief history of the Operating System. Next the tutorial walks you through a few options for different Linux distributions and gives a brief description for each. Although I have slight experience with a different distribution than the one recommended by the tutorial, I chose to use Ubuntu, which is recommended by the tutorial.  Next the tutorial walks you through how to load the appropriate .iso file and make a bootable USB drive. It also gives you options to install Linux on a Virtual Machine or install from a CD-ROM. I chose to use a bootable flash drive. Next, the tutorial begins to delve a little deeper.  This section discusses some of the differences between Windows and Linux.  In particular, the differences in file structure. While Windows stores files in folders on drives, such as C: D: E:, Linux files are ordered in a tree structure. In addition to having a different file structure, Linux also handles files differently.  Some of the different file types are discussed.  Next the tutorial covers the three types of users in Linux. This section is important to have a grasp on as it details a lot of the functional differences between Linux and Windows. The last section of the Linux Fundamentals portion covers briefly the command line interface (CLI) and the graphical user interface (GUI) that can be used to manage files within a Linux system. Some common commands can be used to set a working directory, change directories, and navigate throughout directories. The tutorial walks you through how to open the terminal and run a few commands via the CLI. Next you will move onto the “Getting Started” portion of the tutorial. This portion of the tutorial will cover more in depth some of the commands you can use in the CLI to perform various actions within Linux. Some of the commands covered are used to list files, delete files, move files or rename files. One interesting thing to note is when pasting commands into the terminal, you need to use CRTL + Shift + p. Some other things covered in this section are how to install software using the apt command and sending emails through the terminal. The “cheat sheet” provided details the commands and what they do in Linux. The next section covers the various aspects of file permissions. There are three permissions within Linux, the ability to read, write, and execute.  Next it goes in depth about how to change permissions for users, groups, and others. That completes the “Getting Started” portion and now you will move onto “Advance Stuff”. This section begins with redirection of input and output devices. The standard input is the keyboard, while the standard output is the screen. Using redirection, the standard input/output can be changed. The next topic covered in the tutorial goes over what a Pipe is. A Pipe is a command that lets you use two or more commands, where the output of one command is used as the input for the next command. This can allow you to perform more complex operations in a quick manner. The Grep command can be used to search text files for specific things. The Sort command can be used to sort the contents of a file alphabetically, reverse, numerically, etc. Next the tutorial covers some regularly used expressions. This section is worth noting as it contains relevant syntax to use when operating in Linux, particularly when searching data and matching complex patterns. Next the tutorial shifts to the “Know the OS” portion.  This portion of the tutorial covers what a computing environment is, what a variable is, as well as what an environment variable is and how to access or set new environmental variables. Environment variables essentially rule the way your programs behave within the OS. The next section covers some of the basic utilities that you may need when communicating with other devices. Commands covered in this section are SSH, Ping, FTP, and Telnet. Ping is commonly used to check connection with the server you are communicating with. Telnet helps you to connect to a remote Linux computer, and FTP is the preferred protocol for sending and receiving large files. The tutorial moves onto explain processes, both foreground and background, and various ways to interact with processes on your computer. For instance, the ps command can be used similar to the “Task Manager” in Windows. The kill command can then be used to end a process. The next sections covers the vi editor, which is a commonly used Linux text editor.  In this section, how to launch the vi editor is covered as well as various commands that will be very useful for editing text files and writing scripts. The next section covers what a kernel is, what a shell is, and some of the basics of shell scripting. The next section covers a Virtual Terminal, which you cannot use a mouse.  It covers some of the commands you can use to operate within the Virtual Console without the use of a mouse. This section has some very useful keyboard shortcuts. The next section begins to cover some of the more administrative duties that can be performed and how to perform them in Linux. Some of these duties include creating, modifying, and deleting users. It shows you how to do this through the terminal or using GUI. You can use the finger command to get information on a user both locally and remotely. In the last portion of this tutorial, the guide goes over some of the key differences between Linux and Unix. This section has a history of both Linux and Unix as well as detailing some of the key differences. One to note is that Unix can not be loaded onto a bootable USB. After this section there are a few Q & A sections that you may find interesting. Overall, I enjoyed working through this tutorial and I think the knowledge I have gained will greatly benefit me in my future career. The tutorial did a great job of explaining and relating Linux to Windows, with which I am much more familiar. This greatly aided in my understanding of this tutorial and the material presented.
