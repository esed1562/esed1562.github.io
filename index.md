**Power BI** (Completed 15 November 2018)

Power BI is a Microsoft program that deals with business analytics.  It can be used to provide useful insights to allow users to make fast and informed decisions.  For this class, students were tasked with completing the EdX training for Power BI. The course is self-paced and takes approximately 12 hours to complete.  The materials and content covered in the training greatly aide in understanding and working with Power BI. The videos and labs associated with the videos provide a clear and concise overview of the materials, with most videos noting additional sources of information, should you choose to go more in-depth with a given topic. Power BI is a robust and functional analytics service that I am happy to have learned and had the opportunity to work hands-on through the labs. The content of the course is broken up into 9 sections. In each section, the topics will be further divided into specific tools or functions of Power BI.  Each short video in these sections averages around 3-5 minutes per topic. At the end of a section, there are knowledge checks.  The knowledge check are short, often multiple choice questions that you have 2 attempts at answering the questions correctly.  After the knowledge checks associated with a given section, there will be lab exercises to complete.  The labs are generally straightforward and later labs will require you to have successfully completed previous labs. There is a brief introduction before starting the course, with an associated pre-course survey.  After providing a brief overview of how-to setup and install Power BI, the introduction gives you a brief overview of some of the features of Power BI and what it can be used for. The first section covers Power BI Desktop Data Transformations.  This first section covers some basics like merging columns and other basic data transformations, such as changing data types and adding conditional statements.  Section 2 is Power BI Desktop Modelling.  This section builds on the previous and covers topics such as optimizing models, creating calculated columns, including/excluding, and grouping/binning. Like section 1, Section 2 has knowledge checks and a lab associated with the videos. Section 3 is Power BI Desktop Visualization. This section covers a variety of different charts, plots, and diagrams that you can use to visualize your data. I found the map visualization to be very impressive compared to similar charts in Excel or R. The charts are also interactive and more precise values can be seen while hovering over a field or chart. This is one of the longer sections and really does a great job of covering the functionality and different real-world use cases for each of the different types of charts and how to customize the layout and colors of the charts.  I was really amazed at how robust and easy to use this software is. In addition, Section 3 also covers hierarchies, positioning and layout, as well as seeing a visual relationship between different data sets. Section 3 also has a lab associated with it.  Section 4 covers Power BI Service.  Section 4 covers a web-page style version of Power BI Desktop.  This can be used to publish and share various reports with other people.  These other users may be within your organization or may be a third-party. This section also covers different ways in which you can create a dashboard and use it to gain useful insights about your data. It covers how to add text boxes, how to filter the dashboard, as well as how to upload various files to Power BI Service. I was also very interested in the Natural Query Language that can be utilized through Power BI Service. Section 4 also has a lab associated with it. Section 5 covers Working with Excel. This section details the various functions and uses of Excel with Power BI. It covers some more in-depth concepts with the types of data excel has and how Power BI handles them. There is an associated lab with Section 5. Section 6 covers Organization Packs, Security and Groups.  This section details how to group and provide different security settings or who has access to what data. It covers how to create and manage groups. It discussed what a content pack is, how to create and manage one, and some particular functions when using OneDrive with Power BI. There is a lab associated with Section 6. Section 7 covers Direct Connectivity. This section deals with how to link active SQL Azure, SQL Database, and SQL Server Analytics Service with Power BI. Section 7 has a lab associated with it. Section 8 covers Developer API and contains the final lab required to complete the course. This section seemed to be far more technical than the rest. It covers how to create and manage custom visuals and embedding tiles to reports pages. Section 9, the final section, covers some of the functionality of the mobile app. This final section has no knowledge checks or labs associated with it.  Once you have completed these 9 sections, there is a Course Wrap-Up.  This is where they thank you for taking their course. There is a brief post-course survey where they ask your opinion about how you enjoyed the course, what you would improve, and how much you feel that you learned. 

**Microsoft PowerShell** (completed 30 October 2018)

[Found Here](https://mva.microsoft.com/MyMVA/Dashboard.aspx) 

PowerShell is a task-based command-line scripting and shell language built on .Net framework. PowerShell lets you manage computers from the command-line. This course is far more technical than other skills learned in this class. PowerShell is a very robust and functional program. Tasks are performed by cmdlets or command-lets and allow administrators the ability to perform tasks on both local and remote machines. PowerShell also has an extremely helpful console-based help system. The videos in this course are longer than the videos of the other courses. This makes things slightly more challenging when re-watching content and trying to find a specific topic in the video. Don’t be afraid to go back and re-watch the videos to ensure you have the concepts down. I would also recommend to have the assessments open during the videos so you can pinpoint where a topic was discussed within the videos. I would also recommend speeding the video to 1.5x, it is still easy to follow along with the increase in speed. The videos are very in-depth explanations of the various uses and ways to automate procedures with PowerShell. The two presenters have good chemistry and provide useful anecdotes throughout the videos. 


**GitHub** ( completed 27 August 2018)

**Amazon Web Services** ( completed 12 November 2018)

For this skill, we were tasked with completing the Amazon Web Services Cloud Practitioner course offered through AWS Training. This training covers various products and services that Amazon offers.  This training provides an overview of what the services entail and a brief demonstration of how to use them. After every section there are knowledge checks before you can move on. These knowledge checks are multiple choice and can be retaken. Each section of this course covers different material and is generally broken up into short videos. Section 1 helps you to gain an understanding of the value of the cloud and the benefits of adopting AWS cloud. Throughout this course you will learn Cloud Concepts, AWS Core Services, Security, Architecting, Pricing and Support, as well as some other essentials. The course takes about 10 hours to complete and is relatively easy compared to the other skills learned during this course. The majority of the information covered is about amazon’s core services and how they operate. Amazon operate on a pay as you go scale, meaning you can allocate resources when you need them and not have to pay for when you don’t need them. AWS also offers a TCO calculator to give you a breakdown of pricing and usage details. Below I will detail a few of the things covered throughout the course in more detail.

-Security Groups: Act like a built-in firewall. The security groups provide control on what traffic you want to allow or deny by setting rules for different security groups. 

-Elastic Load Balancer. Load balancing aides with scalability. It will scale based on the traffic pattern it sees. You can view HTTP responses, the number of healthy/unhealthy hosts, and filter metrics based on availability zones. 

-Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).  S3 is managed cloud storage service that can be accessed anytime from anywhere, with virtually unlimited number of objects, and has rich security controls. It is commonly used for storing application assets, static web hosting, backup/disaster recovery, etc. 

-Amazon Glacier is a Data Archiving Solution. Glacier is used for storing Cold data. It offers long-term storage at low cost. Access can be limited by vault access policies. 

-Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed service that sets up and operates a relational database in the cloud. It handles challenges with managing a stand-alone relational database. Some common uses include mobile and online games, as well as web and mobile applications. 

-AWS Trusted Advisor is a tool that gives best practices to ensure you are utilizing your resources properly.  It can measure cost optimization, performance, security, and fault tolerances. 

-Amazon Shared Responsibility Model- This model essentially means that Amazon is responsible for operating managing services of the cloud. Customers are responsible for what they put on the cloud.
